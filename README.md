This is my Vim configuration, and it was from another vimer, I usually use Emacs as my editor, but Emacs can't repalce of Vim in some situations, and I really can't bear the default configration of Vim, So I will change it as I want when I'm going to possess that machine everytime, this is called "revolution".

###Recipe

	mv ~/.vim ~/.vim_bk ; git clone https://github.com/kenchowcn/vimc.git ~/.vim/vimc && ln -s ~/.vim/vimc/vimrc ~/.vimrc && echo "Install success."
